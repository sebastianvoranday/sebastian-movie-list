# Seb's Movie List Creation

The development concepts used are similar to rigs used by news graphics teams in newsrooms like NPR. Here, they are applied in the making of my personal movie list, recommended to anyone who wants to watch the 50 greatest movies of our time.

## Features

This Node-based rig uses a Gulp workflow configured for Github Pages publishing. Features include:

- [Bootstrap 4.4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
- [Nunjucks Templating](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) with [`journalize`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/journalize) filters.
- Ability to configure Google Sheets and Docs (with [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/)) to manage data and content.
